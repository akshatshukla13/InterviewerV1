## A Simple Guide to React Forms with react-hook-form

### Introduction
Handling forms in React can sometimes feel complicated due to state management and re-renders. The `react-hook-form` library simplifies this process by using uncontrolled components and refs for better performance and cleaner code.

---

### Why Use react-hook-form?
- **Performance:** Fewer re-renders by using refs instead of state.
- **Simplicity:** Concise syntax with minimal boilerplate.
- **Validation:** Built-in validation and easy integration with schema validators like Yup or Zod.
- **Size:** Lightweight (~10KB gzipped).

### Installation
To use `react-hook-form`, first install it in your React project:

```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```

---

### Basic Example
Here's a simple login form using `react-hook-form`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

function InterviewPortalLogin() {
    const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm();
    const onSubmit = (data) => // console.log(data);

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
            <div>
                <label>Name:</label>
                <input 
                    placeholder="Enter your name" 
                    {...register("namee", { required: "Name is required" })} 
                />
                {errors.namee && <p>{errors.namee.message}</p>}
            </div>

            <div>
                <label>Email:</label>
                <input 
                    placeholder="Enter your email" 
                    {...register("email", { 
                        required: "Email is required", 
                        pattern: { 
                            value: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/, 
                            message: "Invalid email format" 
                        } 
                    })} 
                />
                {errors.email && <p>{errors.email.message}</p>}
            </div>

            <div>
                <label>Password:</label>
                <input 
                    type="password" 
                    placeholder="Enter your password" 
                    {...register("password", { required: "Password is required" })} 
                />
                {errors.password && <p>{errors.password.message}</p>}
            </div>

            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}

export default InterviewPortalLogin;
```

---

### Explanation
- **useForm()**: Initializes form control methods like `register`, `handleSubmit`, and `formState`.
- **register()**: Connects input fields to the form's internal state and sets up validation rules.
- **handleSubmit()**: A wrapper that handles form submission, runs validations, and calls the `onSubmit` function if the form is valid.
- **formState.errors**: Contains validation errors, which can be used to display error messages.

---

### Validation
You can add more validation rules like this:

```jsx
<input 
    {...register("email", { 
        required: "Email is required", 
        pattern: { 
            value: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/, 
            message: "Invalid email format" 
        } 
    })} 
    placeholder="Enter your email"
/>
{errors.email && <p>{errors.email.message}</p>}
```

---

### Conclusion
Using `react-hook-form`, you can create powerful, performant forms with minimal effort. It simplifies validation, reduces re-renders, and integrates easily with other libraries.
